# E-Commerce Website

Welcome to the E-Commerce Website project! This project is an online store created, I hope:blush:, using modern front-end technologies for web application development.

## Technologies

### Frontend

**üöÄReact.js:** Used to build the user interface and create components that provide a dynamic and responsive web page.

**‚òëÔ∏èStyled-components:** A library for writing CSS inside JavaScript. Used for writing styled project content inside components. Done to test the library's capabilities.

**‚òëÔ∏èFramer Motion:** A library for adding animations and interactive effects to an application. There are very few animations in this version of the project, but will be used as needed in future versions. Also, the use of the library was in a test format to evaluate the interaction with Styled-components.

**‚òëÔ∏èMaterial-UI Icons (mui/icons):** Iconic components to improve visual design and ease of interaction with the interface. Plus flexible customization of this library and additional functionality justify the choice.

### This project is one part of a global project built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
